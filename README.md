# WEBP SUX!!!!
A little Python applet that allows you to convert WebP images into a more usable format, like PNG or JPeG

Have you ever been trying to make something on Photoshop only to find out that the image you've *just* downloaded is a `.webp` and Photoshop can't open it?
### Well I have.
And I'm sick of it.

Now, with this handy little desktop app (that will eventually have a UI), you can (will be able to) drag and drop the `.webp` that you want to make usable into the app, select what you want it as, and then hit convert.

I made this for myself. I'm sick of this issue, it really limits me creatively.

## How do I set up the Repo for myself?
Great, I'm glad you asked.
First, clone the repo. Then it should just open in a Python IDE like PyCharm. I used Python 3.11 and the following libraries:
- PIL (fork, named Pillow)
- OS
- Tkinter

Once you've got these installed by running `pip install {name of library}`, you should be ready to play around with the project. The structure isn't particularly complex (like one or two files maybe?) but give it a whirl.
